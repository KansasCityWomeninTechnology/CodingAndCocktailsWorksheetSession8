### Part 3: Create a package.json file {#part-3-create-a-package-json-file}

NPM provides an easy way to create a package.json file, which is where you specify the dependencies you want.

1.  On the command line, type: ``npm init`` This will give you a series of prompted questions.
2.  You can hit enter for each and it will use the default values, which is fine.
3.  When youâ€™re done, use Sublime to open the package.json file it created.
