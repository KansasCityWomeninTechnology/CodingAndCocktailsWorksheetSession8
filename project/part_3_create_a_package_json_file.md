### Part 3: Create a package.json file {#part-3-create-a-package-json-file}

**npm** provides an easy way to create a _package.json_ file, which is where you specify the dependencies you want.

1.  On the command line, type: `npm init` This will give you a series of prompted questions.

2.  You can hit enter for each and it will use the default values, which is fine.

3.  When you're done, use Atom to open & look through the _package.json_ file it created.
