Browserify will allow you to easily consume new dependencies with the javascript **require** statement.

  #### Sudo warnings & passwords
  The **sudo** prefix is like running an application as **root** or **administrator**. On a mac, you might get a warning like _Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss..._ We're not doing anything dangerous here, just installing the browserify tool via **npm**, which requires this level of system access.
