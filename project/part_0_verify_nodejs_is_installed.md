### Part 0: Verify NodeJS is installed {#part-0-verify-nodejs-is-installed}

In order to use **npm**, you have to install NodeJS. (We won’t be writing a NodeJS application, but the two are essentially installed together.)

1.  Open your terminal / command line

  {% hint style='info' %}
  The **terminal** and **command line** (aka **CLI**, command line interface) are the same thing.

  - On Windows, this is **Git Bash**
  - On Mac, this is **iTerm2**
  {% endhint %}

2.  Type: ``node -v``

3.  If you get a version number, you’re good. Proceed to Part 1.

  {% hint style='danger' %}
  ####Command not found

  If your system doesn't recognize the node command, it's probably not installed. You can get it from http://nodejs.org.
  {% endhint %}
