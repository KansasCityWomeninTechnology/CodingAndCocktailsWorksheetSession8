### Part 6: Use the new dependency {#part-6-use-the-new-dependency}

Now weâ€™re ready to put the new dependency (lodash) to good use.

1.  In Atom, copy or type the following into _index.js_, then save again:

  ```
  var _ = require('lodash');
  var wine = "I like red wine";
  var h4Heading = document.querySelector('h4');
  h4Heading.textContent = _.replace(wine, 'red', 'white');
  ```

2.  On the command line, type: `browserify index.js > bundle.js`

3.  Refresh (or open again) _index.html_ in Chrome.

Your rendered HTML file should look like this:
