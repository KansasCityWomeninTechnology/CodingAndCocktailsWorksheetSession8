### Part 1: Use the new jQuery dependency {#part-1-use-the-new-jquery-dependency}

Your _index.js_ file already contains one way of selecting an element (`document.querySelector`). Now that you have jQuery, you can do this another way:

1.  In Atom, open the _index.js_ file and type the following code anywhere in the file:

  ```
  var $ = require('jquery');
  $('h4').css('color', 'white');
  ```

2.  On the command line, type the browserify command again: `browserify index.js > bundle.js`

3.  Refresh (or reopen) _index.html_ in Chrome.

Your rendered HTML file should look like this:

### Part 2: Initialize your project as a git repository {#part-2-initialize-your-project-as-a-git-repository}

Start tracking your progress with git. We’re going to tell git what it should _and should not_ care about.

1.  On the command line, type the following: ``git init``

2.  Now type: ``git status`` This command lists the files and folders git thinks it should track.

3.  In Atom, create a new file called **.gitignore** (note, this file starts with a dot). See Part 2 of the project section above if you need help creating new files.

4.  Add the following to the **.gitignore** file and save it:

        /node_modules
        bundle.js

        #For macs
        .DS_Store

5.  Back on the command line, type this again: ``git status`` Notice that the **node_modules** folder and **bundle.js** file are no longer listed.

6.  Stage and commit these files.<br>
