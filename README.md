### Overview {#overview}

Dependencies are references to code that someone else wrote. People publish this code by creating node packages. Node packages are open-source, which means you don’t have to pay to use it. Most websites and apps are built with some kind of dependencies.

The mission tonight is to create a simple project and add dependencies to it with **npm**. We’ll use each new dependency in some small way.
