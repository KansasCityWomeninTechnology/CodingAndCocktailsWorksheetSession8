1. In your terminal, navigate to your "packagesproject" folder. You can use the `pwd` command to see what folder you're in. If you aren't in the "packagesproject" folder, you can use the following commands for your OS and press `Enter`.
  {% codetabs name="Mac", type="bash" -%} 
cd ~/CodingAndCocktails/packagesproject
   {%- language name="Windows", type="bash" -%} 
cd %USERPROFILE%/CodingAndCocktails/packagesproject
   {%- endcodetabs %}

1. In your terminal type, `atom .` to open Atom IDE.

  {% hint style='tip' %}
#### Command not found
If Atom doesn't open (but you know it's installed), your system probably doesn't recognize the `atom` command.

You can configure your system to recognize the command (ask a mentor for help) or you can follow these steps to open it manually:

1. From your applications or start menu, open Atom
2. In Atom: **File** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> **Open...** (Mac) or **Open Folder...** (Windows)
3. Open the "packagesproject" folder
4. Click the **Open** button

- Instead of Atom, you'll be using the built-in text editor in your workspace. 

- To create a file in CodeAnywhere, right click on the folder and select **Create File**. 

Continue to next the section.
