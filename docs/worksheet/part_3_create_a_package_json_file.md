## Create a package.json file

**npm** provides an easy way to create a _package.json_ file, which is where you specify the dependencies you want.

{% hint style='danger' %}
Make sure your current working directory is _packagesproject_ before you start these steps. [Hint: Run `pwd` from your CLI to double-check.]
{% endhint %}

1.  On the command line, type: `npm init`<i class="fa fa-share fa-rotate-180"></i>. This will give you a series of prompted questions used to create the _package.json_ file.

1.  You can press `Enter` for each prompt and it will use the default values, which is fine. When you press `Enter` for the last prompt, **Is this ok? (yes)**, the _package.json_ file will generate.

1. When you're done, use Atom to open and look through the _package.json_ file it created.

You're doing great! Grab a refreshing drink, you've earned it!
