### Part 3: Create a package.json file {#part-3-create-a-package-json-file}

**npm** provides an easy way to create a _package.json_ file, which is where you specify the dependencies you want.

{% hint style='danger' %}
Make sure your current working directory is _packagesproject_ before you start these steps. [Hint: Run `pwd` from your CLI to double-check.]
{% endhint %}

1.  On the command line, type: `npm init` This will give you a series of prompted questions that will be used to create the _package.json_ file.

2.  You can hit enter for each prompt and it will use the default values, which is fine. When you hit enter for the last prompt, **Is this ok? (yes)**, the _package.json_ file will be generated.

3.  When you're done, use Atom to open & look through the _package.json_ file it created.

You're doing great! Grab a refreshing drink, you've earned it!
